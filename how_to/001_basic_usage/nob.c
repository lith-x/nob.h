// This is your build script. You only need to "bootstrap" it once with `cc -o nob nob.c`
// (you can call the executable whatever actually) or `cl nob.c` on MSVC. After that every

// itself automatically thanks to NOB_GO_REBUILD_URSELF (see below)

// nob.h is an stb-style library https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt
// What that means is that it's a single file that acts both like .c and .h files, but by default
// when you include it, it acts only as .h. To make it include implementations of the functions
// you must define NOB_IMPLEMENTATION macro. This is done to give you full control over where
// the implementations go.
#define NOB_IMPLEMENTATION

// Always keep a copy of nob.h in your repo. One of my main pet peeves with build systems like CMake
// and Autotools is that the codebases that use them naturally rot. That is if you do not actively update
// your build scripts, they may not work with the latest version of the build tools. Here we basically
// include the entirety of the source code of the tool along with the code base. It will never get
// outdated (unless you got no standard compliant C compiler lying around, but at that point why are
// you trying to build a C project?)
//
// (In these examples we actually symlinking nob.h, but this is to keep nob.h-s synced among all the
// examples)
#include "nob.h"

// Some folder paths that we use throughout the build process.
#define BUILD_FOLDER "build/"
#define SRC_FOLDER   "src/"
